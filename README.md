# Story 
In a world, not so far away from the sun, an alien named HYG3K crash-landed
on the plant called FRUTH. Toss far away from its ship landed on a
subcontinent called NNILAT has to gain strength and sustenance to reach his
ship on the other side of FRUTH and leave the plant. Help our hero eat right to
be able to complete his journey.
Our friendly alien has to consume sustenance in the basic food category
available on FRUTH, which are CARBOHYDRATE, PROTEIN, FATS, MINERALS,
WATER, and VITAMINS to balance his INSTAGROMETER, and also avoid the
CREEPS (a monster that makes our friendly alien drained of all its sustenance,
and makes him perish). Because our alien isn’t from FRUTH it can only survive
for 2mins on the planet’s atmosphere so TIME is really important because
when it runs out it could put our alien to ZOOON (which makes the KYG3K
sleep forever).
